# Extreme Rainfall Interpolation
This python project is intended to be used to generate estimates of extreme rainfall ranging between 1 in 2000 AEP and PMP using one of three interpolation methods:
1. A parabolic method in log-log scale as per Siriwardena & Weinmann (1998)
2. A parabolic method in log-normal scale as per Hill et al. (2000)
3. An inverse cumulative distribution function for the generalised extreme value (GEV) distribution as per Sharpe (2024)
